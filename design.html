                            This project took place over the course of 4 weeks with an intended goal of designing a functional application for our assigned client “Don’t Let Daddy Know”, a well known large scale music festival organisers based out of Amsterdam. The intended learning outcomes were to brainstorm and ideate the best functionality, usability and layout for an application that most suitably fits the purpose of addressing problems faced by customers who have already experienced an event organised by our clients. Figure One showcases High Resolution mock up of the home page of the final application.

                            The first task we addressed  to tackle this project was to have a strong research to back up our models. For this, we thought it would be best to combine findings of both context and user research. Two of my teammates led the research and found multiple resources to utilise as our context research . Then, they made a survey that asks existing DLDK concert goers questions about their experience . To achieve this, they sent out the survey amongst multiple different reddit and discord groups that have already been to Don’t let Daddy Know. Finally, they managed to deduce the three most common problems faced by existing customers. My role during this preliminary process was limited to interviewing with three customers who went to the festival and to develop a few of the sample questions required for the survey. Figure One showcases the final set of complications that was deduced from the combined user and context research findings.                          </p>

                            In this project, i took on the role of a visual illustrator & UI/UX designer. To best pursue this project, i chose to address the two of the three main complications based off our research and designed an application that can best address them to give our clients customers the best experience. The designing process started with hand drawn sketches by me that were then converted into low fidelity wire frames by my teammate Jihoon Lee.   Figure 7 showcases these wire frames based off which i created the final iteration.

                            The application has an intended purpose of constantly updating the artist schedule times and to locate customer friend groups on each others interfaces so customers would not separate from their friend groups. The application has other functionalities including an AR camera functionality that would virtually emulate directions to your selected friend . The application can also store customer tickets and has an additional apple watch application that lets them enter the concert without any hassle .                            </p>

                        Using these wire frames as my reference, i went on design high resolution mock ups for the application and 
                        Upon further critique recieved from our professor Russell Taylor and Teaching Assistant at the time Breanne Lewis, I managed to further refine my designs for the application and i have below. I have also made flows for the application using Adobe XD to better showcase the applications intended workflow .
